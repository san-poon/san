# A Catalyst for Radical Change

We must introduce radical changes while the momentum from this protest still exists; otherwise, I'm afraid it could take another decade or more for a similar movement to arise, forcing us to endure this again. Corruption is the main culprit and must be made impossible to hide in the dark. One systemic feature I keep returning to is digital transparency, which means publishing all government spending, contracts, and bids, from federal to local levels, in real-time on a single, searchable portal, including details on company owners, contract amounts, and terms.

This serves as a catalyst, like the first pillar in a domino effect. Before the momentum fades, we must integrate this or another foundational element into the system, so that all subsequent reforms such as an truly independent anti-corruption authority with prosecutorial power, judicial independence for swift case handling, asset declarations and verification for elected officials etc, can naturally emerge from it.

If not, I fear the deaths and chaos will have been in vain.
